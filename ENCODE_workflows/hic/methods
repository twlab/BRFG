# Hi-C Methods

##
# Data
We used Hi-C data from the HPRC Year 1 samples HG00621, HG00741, HG01952, HG01978, and HG03516.
Each sample has 2 replicates with 4 paired end sets for 16 fastq files, with reads 150 bps long.
Total size of the FASTQ files averaged around 130 GB.

##
# Align
Sample replicate FASTQ file pairs were aligned using BWA's "BWA-MEM" [] aligner.

Ligation count is generated, but not used for ours

# Chimera Sam Nonspecific
Each resulting BAM from BWA-MEM alignment was processed with the ligation count file through Juicer's [] "adjust_insert_size.awk" and "chimeric_sam.awk" scripts producing a BAM.

# Merge
The BAMs from chimera processing were merged together with SWamtools [] "merge" and then sorted.

# Dedup
The merged replicate BAM was depulicated with Juicer's "dups_sam.awk" script.

# Calculate Stats on Library
Stats were calculated using Juicer's "stats_sub.awk" script and "juicer statistics" sub command.
Stats files are saved as TXT, JSON, and HIST formats.

##
# Merge All Replicates
The replicates were merged for each sample with Samtools "merge" to create a sorted and deduplicated BAM.

##
# Run Analysis Filter on Map Quality of 1 & 30
# BAM to PRE
The merged replicate BAM is converted to the "pre" input format using Juicer's "sam_to_pre.awk", filtering on mapping quality 1 and 30.
The "pre" file is iundexed with Juicer's "index_by_chr.awk".

# Create Hi-C
Hi-C ("hic") files are created using the Juicer's "pre" command.

# Add Norm
The "hic" files are normalized with Juicer's "normalization_command".

# Eignvector 5K & 10K
Each Hi-C file is run through Aiden Lab's "newGW_Intra_Flip" to create eigenvectors at resolutions 5KB and 10KB.
Then wigToBigWig [] was used to convert the eigenvector output "wig" to "bigwig" format"

# Hiccups {Loops}
Loops are called with Juicer's "hiccups" command.

# Arrowhead {TADs}
TADs are called with Juicer's "arrowhead" command.

##
# Use MapQ 30 Hi-C
The Hi-C (Hi-C30) file with minimum mapping quality of 30 is then used to run 2 programs. 

# Delta
The Hi-C30 file is processed using Juicer's "straw" data extractor to run data through DELPHI [] (né DELTA), a set of deep learning neural networks for predicting chromatin loops, domains, and stripes.

# Slice 25k 50k 100k
Mixer Tools' [] "SLICE" (Subcompartment Landscape Identification via Clustering Enrichments) is run (resolutions: 25k, 50k, & 100k) to generate a bed file of subcompartment clusters.
